> a new framework for [sass][0]

## Why

Because I love to code, and wanted something namespaced as to not collide with
existing frameworks (bootstrap `@size` vs bourbon `@size` for example).

This project is in its early stage of development - only published at this point
to reserve the package name; more details will follow.

## Install

```bash
npm install o- --save-dev
```
