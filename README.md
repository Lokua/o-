# o- 

###### pronounced "Oh Dash"

> micro-framework for [sass][0]

## Why

Because I love to code, and wanted something simple and namespaced as to not collide with
existing frameworks (bootstrap `@size` vs bourbon `@size` for example).

This project is in its early stage of development - published at this point
to reserve the package name. Names, structure, and implementations will surely change; more details will follow.

## Install

```bash
npm install o- --save-dev
```

## Usage

```sass
@import path_to_node_modules/o-/o-
```

Refer to the API documentation for placeholder, 
function, and mixin specifics located at [./demo/index.html](./demo/index.html)
